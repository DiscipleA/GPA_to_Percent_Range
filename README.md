 IT212 Assignment: GPA to Percentage Range

# GPA to Percentage Converter

This is a simple Java program that converts a GPA input into its corresponding **percentage range** and displays the result.

## 🚀 How It Works
- The user inputs their GPA value.
- The program determines which percentage bracket the GPA belongs to.
- It then outputs a formatted message like --> 3.2   < 88.0% to 87.0%

## 🛠 Features
- Covers GPA ranges from **0.0% up to 100.0%**.
- Uses a **switch-case structure** to handle each percentage bracket.
- Provides clear output for both valid and invalid inputs.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the `.java` file.
2. Compile the program:
 ```bash
 javac GPAPercentRange.java
 java GPAPercentRange.java
 ```
3. Enter a GPA value when prompted.

📌 Example Output

Enter GPA (or type 'exit' to quit): 2.0

2.0   < 76.0% to 75.0%
